# Perfect-loop gif using NeRF



# Data
Data is from CO3D dataset.
**TODO: add images**

# Organizing Camera positions
** TODO: 
1) Detect the part of the scene where the camera maps the object more than once (if the images show more than 360 degree capture, then there are parts of the scenes where the camera translates more than once).
2) Using NeRF generate images in that specific part once
3) attach the generated images to the rest of the scene images.**

   
**for more smooth gif: sample more camera positions throughout the entire 360 scene.**

# TensoRF for NeRF
TensoRF is a voxel based neural radiance fields. Easy and fast.
